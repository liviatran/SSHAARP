# SSHAARP -- Searching Shared HLA Amino Acid Residue Prevalence

The goal of the SSHAARP (Searching Shared HLA Amino Acid Residue Prevalence) project is to develop a system that uses multi-population HLA allele frequency data to identify the frequency of specific amino-acid residue motif sequences (SFVTs) around the globe. The primary aims of the project are to (1) process amino acid alignments produced by the IPD-IMGT/HLA Database to allow the identification of user-defined amino acid residue motifs shared across HLA alleles, (2) calculate the frequencies of those motifs based on HLA allele frequency data, and (3) generate global frequency maps that illustrate the distribution of each user-defined motif around the globe. Secondary aims are to (1) process allele frequency data housed in the Allele Frequencies Net Database (AFND), and (2) create a web-tool that allows anyone to run the primary functions on AFND data.
